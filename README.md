## Submission for [patch notes game jam](https://itch.io/jam/patch-notes)

A funky autobattler + card game that put you in the role of a developer whose game canâ€™t even launch when the jam submission deadline is just hours away! Sounds familiar?

Help him fix the game in time by squashing those bugs and glitches by playing cards, buffing your army of AI chatbots and making the best use of unexpected new bugs opportunities.
