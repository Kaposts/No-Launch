## Submission for [Patch Notes v1.0 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/patch-notes)

A funky autobattler + card game that put you in the role of a developer whose game canâ€™t even launch when the jam submission deadline is just hours away!

Help him fix the game in time by squashing those bugs and glitches by playing cards, buffing your army of AI chatbots and making the best use of unexpected ~~new bugs~~ opportunities.

Patch Notes v1.0 game jam was organized by Indieformer, submission ran from 12th of September, 2025 to 15th of September, 2025.
